# MERN-Pizza Food Delivery Web App 

> I have developed this amazing Pizza Delivering site Using MERN Stack Development Project technologies . It is not a complete production website but it is used as a demo version to get an idea how to make a complete Full-Stack website using MERN .

N - Node.js (It is used for server-side programming, and primarily deployed for non-blocking, event-driven servers, such as traditional web sites and back-end API services)<br>
