<b>MERN-Pizza Food Delivery Web App</b>
I have developed this amazing Pizza Delivering site Using MERN Stack Development Project technologies . It is not a complete production website but it is used as a demo version to get an idea how to make a complete Full-Stack website using MERN . It can be further modified to make it a deployment stage for commercial purpose uses.

MERN Stands for :
M - Mongodb (No-SQL Database it store the values in key:value format , faster than any sql database)
E - Express.js (Express.js, or simply Express, is a back end web application framework for building RESTful APIs with Node.js)
R - React.js (React is a free and open-source front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces based on components)
N - Node.js (It is used for server-side programming, and primarily deployed for non-blocking, event-driven servers, such as traditional web sites and back-end API services)

In this project we have added multiple features , so that user can get smoother experience while giving an order...
